MODEL:

This submission contains a vehicel model created with Simscape Multibody.
Simply uncompress the zip, open the mdoel and run.
Enjoy!

ABOUT THE MODEL:

This model shows how to represent vehicle and suspension dynamics with Simscape Multibody. 
The model offers a visualization of the system response. The Contact Forces Library is used to model 
contact between the wheel and the floor (Sphere to Plane approximation). Keep in mind that this
approximation may have some limitations, but it serves as a good starting point. In addition, keep in
mind that the focus of this submission is not tire modeling, the focus is system-level vehicle and 
suspension modeling. This entry reinforces the concepts reviewed in the Vehicle Modeling 
video series, more specifically Part 4.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:

The Simscape Multibody model uses the following MathWorks products, all from R2017a release:
1)MATLAB
2)Simulink
3)Simscape
4)Aerospace Blockset

If the listed products are not installed on your machine, the models will not run.
